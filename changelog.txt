Changes in 0.1.2

+ reworked fleet system
+ reworked tile system
+ you can become a pirate now
+ added 1 item (that doesnt sound very impressive does it?)
+ upped some equipment costs (you are not buying a single gauss gun, you are upgrading your ships armory)
+ added 1 special planet and reworked 5 of the old ones
+ cave systems are less uniform (they variate on "cavyness" and "tunneleyness"
+ consistent warnings on low oxygen levels
+ Jumppacks allow for the daring "emergency jumppack jump" maneuver
+ invisibles are really invisible now
+ Stations now attempt to offer entertainment to their customers
+ pirates really get agressive when you have high price cargo (In 0.1.1 only one pirate got agressive, and always the same one too)
+ another nerf to scanning (your level 5 science officer also needs level 5 sensors)
+ nerf to orbit correction : Its less nagging now, but it also won't kill you
+ warning if you leave the station with an officer missing
+ missing officer now has a skill of -5 instead of just 0
+ docking on a station with a missing officer caused a division by 0. fixed
